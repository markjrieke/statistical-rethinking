The Golem of Prague
================

## 1.1 Statistical Golems

-   *Golem*: Hebrew myth of a creation with incredible strength that
    follows orders exactly. Poorly formed orders can lead to disaster!
-   Statistical tests can be thought of as “statistical golems” — when
    we use them without thinking/outside of the narrow context that they
    may be suitable for, we can end up with poor results.

## 1.2 Statistical Rethinking

-   Need to understand the nuts/bolts of the problem/mechanics of the
    statistical test or method to be able to accurately understand it’s
    output.

### 1.2.1 Hypotheses are not models

-   All models are wrong, but some are useful (classic)
-   Statistical models do not express causality, but instead expres
    *associations among variables*

### 1.2.2 Measurement Matters

-   Example: The English thought that all swans were white (H0) until
    visiting Australia & seeing non-white swans
-   Before traveling to Australia, no number of observations would have
    disproven H0!

#### 1.2.2.1 Observation Error

-   Not every swan is black or white — what about intermediate shades?
-   The swan example is a bit too optimistic — finding disconfirmations
    is not always easy/viable!
-   Another example is faster-than-light neutrinos — researchers “found”
    faster-than-light neutrinos, but later found the technical error in
    measurement.

#### 1.2.2.2 Continuous Hypotheses

-   Most interesting hypotheses are continuous — e.g., H0: 80% of swans
    are white

### 1.2.3 Falsification is Consensual

-   Coming to a consensus about evidence is difficult and messy
-   Think of the change from geocentric to solar-centric models of the
    solar system.
